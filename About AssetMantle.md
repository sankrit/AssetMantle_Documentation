# About AssetMantle

## Introduction

NFT marketplaces empower users to buy and sell NFTs regardless of their technical know-how.

They help facilitate easy trading among peers and allow individuals to launch their personal NFT projects, build a personal brand, and even set up a passive income stream that potentially helps them earn in perpetuity.

In other words, NFT marketplaces are online platforms that bridge the gap between buyers and sellers. They function more like an exchange, with people minting and selling NFTs at a set price.

At [AssetMantle](https://assetmantle.one/), the team is dedicated to making NFTs accessible more easily and with greater functionality. The Mantle team is able to achieve this feat of engineering marvel by building on the Cosmos ecosystem and leveraging the flexibility of [InterNFT](https://internft.org/) (an NFT metadata standardization).

## What is AssetMantle?

The Mantle team is building [AssetMantle](https://assetmantle.one/) to empower artists and innovators to pursue their passion in the blockchain. Thus enabling incentivization in perpetuity without the need to code in complex blockchain programming languages.

AssetMantle is a creator-centric framework for NFT marketplaces that provides all the elements required to create individual marketplaces. It facilitates the creation (minting) of interoperable NFTs that flow between different blockchains. Further, it also supports NFTs ranging from digital art, collectibles to tokenized tickets.

With AssetMantle, users can easily create dedicated marketplaces for a wide range of products from specific sellers or groups of sellers.

## Why Did AssetMantle Choose the Cosmos Ecosystem?

### Strategically Ahead

- AssetMantle is a part of the larger Cosmos ecosystem. It is built atop the Tendermint core consensus engine and therefore offers **greater scalability**, **better usability**, and **superior sovereignty** than most other blockchains.
- Further, Cosmos allows extreme interoperability and connectivity with other chains using the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.
- The NFT market is currently untapped in the Cosmos ecosystem, and despite the rapid demand in the NFT space, there is no concrete Cosmos-native marketplace.

### Highly Economical

- The Cosmos network's gas fees are incredibly cheap, and minting assets on the same would be almost free of cost (as compared to Ethereum, which requires massive investment just to mint).
- Users not paying a high gas fee for each transaction encourages the acceleration of mass adoption.
- At the end of the day, AssetMantle’s users enjoy **virtually limitless possibilities to trade NFTs**, negligible gas fees (as low as $0.01), and fast transaction approval (7 seconds) thanks to low network congestion.

### Environment-Friendly Approach

- The NFTs on AssetMantle can be referred to as “Green NFTs” because they consume very little energy. In contrast, Ethereum NFTs (ERC 721 tokens) have faced an enormous backlash from the **environmentally-conscious** due to their large power consumption.
- Many artists and celebrities have opted for Proof of Stake (PoS) powered marketplaces over marketplaces on Ethereum for the same reason. While the Ethereum network is still updating to the Proof of Stake consensus, the ETA is and its implications are still quite uncertain. However, all the chains in the Cosmos network use **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus**.

### Best-in-Class User-Experience

- AssetMantle allows for the seamless integration of web 2.0 experiences so that complications of web 3.0 can be abstracted away.
- AssetMantle allows users to create their own storefronts using a no-code user-friendly drag-and-drop builder.

## Terminology

### **Web 2.0**

Web 2.0 is the second stage of internet development, distinguished particularly by the shift from static web pages to dynamic or user-generated content and the advent of social media.

### **Web 3.0**

Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, dubbed web 3.0 the “Semantic Web”, with the goal of creating a more autonomous, intelligent, and open internet.

The description of web 3.0 may be broadened as follows: data would be networked in a decentralized manner, which would be a significant improvement over our present generation of the internet (web 2.0), where data is largely held in centralized repositories.

### **Stablecoins**

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose prices are intended to be tied to another cryptocurrency, fiat currency, or exchange-traded commodities and their value remains stable relative to the currency it is pegged to.

### **Non-Fungible Tokens**

An NFT or a Non-Fungible Token is a structured unit of data representing the properties of a unique entity or the entity itself( if it’s a digital asset, then all its properties are contained by the NFT).

### **PoS (Proof of Stake)**

Proof of Stake is a consensus mechanism that is used to validate cryptocurrency transactions.

Owners of cryptocurrencies can stake their coins in this system to become validators. This empowers them with the ability to review fresh blocks of transactions and add them to the blockchain.

These validators are then rewarded for their efforts or penalized if they attempt to defraud the system and get caught.

### Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

DPoS is a consensus protocol best suited for public blockchains that envision scaling rapidly without forgoing security by offering Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT).

### **Coin Burning**

Coin burning is the technique by which cryptocurrency miners and developers remove a set percentage of coins from circulation in order to regulate their price. They do this by sending the coins to an address from which they are irretrievable.

### I**nterNFT**

InterNFT is the implementation of the NFT interface. The InterNFT interface is designed to provide maximum application logic freedom in a single interface, focusing on interchain ownership transfer.

It is an NFT metadata standardization (like ERC721 and SG721) supporting up to 22 unique attributes.

### **Storefronts**

A storefront is essentially an e-commerce store.

AssetMantle components enable creators to open their own storefronts wherein they can sell NFTs like they would sell products on an e-commerce store.

Think of it like a fully-customizable plug-and-play platform for NFTs where the project is open-sourced, allowing anybody to create an on-chain interface to represent their own assets in the form of modular NFTs. Artists, curators, and collectors may easily build their own stores with the ability to tailor them to their own demands.

### **IPFS**

InterPlanetary File Storage, or IPFS, is a distributed system that allows you to store and access files, webpages, apps, and other data.

### **Asset Tokenization**

Asset tokenization is the process by which an issuer produces digital tokens that represent either digital or real assets on a distributed ledger or blockchain.

### **InterChain**

InterChain is a blockchain interoperability framework that links all SubChains together.

### IBC Protocol

Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) is a protocol used by the Cosmos ecosystem of blockchains that enables seamless and scalable interoperability and empowers inter-blockchain transfer of assets.

This open-source protocol is what makes Cosmos a sovereign network.

## Tendermint

[Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/) is a core consensus engine developed by [Ignite](https://ignt.com/) on top of which AssetMantle is built using the Cosmos SDK.

## Inception of AssetMantle

AssetMantle was first conceptualized by Deepanshu Tripathi back in the year 2018 when he was working with Comdex, a decentralized enterprise commodity trading platform that is facilitated by tokenizing assets, as the Chief Blockchain Architect.

In the early stages, AssetMantle was only an asset tokenization, NFT minting, and burning protocol in the larger Persistence ecosystem.

Later, the team decided to open source the code and expand AssetMantle into an elaborate framework that empowered creators to build their legacy.
