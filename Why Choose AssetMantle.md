## Salient Features of AssetMantle

### **Minting**

Minting allows a verified creator to simply create/import their assets, work on them & convert them into tradable NFTs which can then be exported to the marketplace

### **Exchange (Bid, Buy, Sell)**

- Using an order-book & signature-based matching
- Multiple asset types supported: Images, Audio, Video, AR/VR, 3D, etc.
- Completely decentralized Web3 based application with no involvement of off-chain or centralized databases
- Built on top of the native InterNFT Standards built by Persistence and the community.

### **Ledger Hardware Support**

Ledger uses state-of-the-art technology to secure your assets and deliver a seamless experience to buy/sell crypto assets. With the recent hacks in wallet-based implementations, it is very important to secure the NFT assets.

AssetMantle now supports the Ledger hardware wallet to store all your NFTs securely and avoid phishing attacks into your wallets.

### **Build Your Very Own Storefront/Marketplace**

MantleBuilder will allow creators to create their own storefronts or NFT marketplaces. This marketplace will further allow users to upload, publish, and sell their minted NFTs.

The storefront will use the underlying protocol level logic to govern the demand & pricing mechanism to control the NFT auction & transactions.

Additional benefits of this marketplace are that economic principles of supply and demand become automatically integrated into the system, allowing the community to determine the fair price of user-generated assets.

### **Storage Mechanism**

- AssetMantle uses IPFS dedicated gateway to store the asset along with the associated metadata.
- AssetMantle verifies the assets using IPFS to prove the authenticity of the minted NFTs.

### InterNFT Standardization

AssetMantle uses interNFT standardization for NFT minting. This empowers creators with the unparalleled flexibility of adding up to 22 unique attributes.

The ownership of interNFT is maintained by the interNFT wallet. The combination of interNFT and interNFT wallet allows the ownership of the interNFT to be exchanged across interoperable chains while the execution logic of the NFT is still maintained at the native chain.
